# AWNPScreensaver

This program is a simple screensaver inspired by The Shining. Text reading "All work and no play." is written across the screen over and over. The letters are "typed" at random intervals to make it seem as if someone is currently typing the script. The script alternates from white to red slowly over time. To use this script, the user must turn it into an executable screensaver file, then save it into System 32 on their PC.
